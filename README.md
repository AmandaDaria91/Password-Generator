# Password-Generator


## Description

A password generator that creates a random password based on user selected criteria. I made use of some begining code which was my HTML and CSS and created the use of the JavaScript Page. 

- My motivation for this project was to take the work out of thinking of a passward and coming up with a unique and strong password based on user specified criteria.
- I built this project because I believe that it will help provide users with stronger security.
- This problem solves the issues users face to create strong and random passwords. 
- I learned how to use JavaScript for my first time and apply it to a real world situation.
